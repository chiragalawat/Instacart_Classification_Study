With the rise in online transactions, companies are trying to leverage the humongous data generated by the transaction activities to transform it to meaningful insights. Data Mining techniques can be used to develop a cross selling strategy for the products. Data scientists use predictive analytics to improve the customer experience of shopping online by developing models that predict which products a user will buy again, or try for the first time, or which products are bought together.

In this paper, we analyze the trend in customer shopping behavior on Instacart website for buying groceries. The data set is made public by Instacart- a same day grocery delivery service, for 3 million transactions of over 200,000 users. Data set is explored using open source statistical learning tool R. 

Market Basket Analysis is done using Apriori algorithm for various support levels, confidence and lift to suggest combination of products to be included in a basket to cross sell the products on the platform. The model is developed to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. The F-score measures the model’s performance.
